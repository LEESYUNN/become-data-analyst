Prosper Exploration Data Analysis
========================================================

[Prosper](prosper.com) is one of the largest financial company who operates P2P lending business. It allows individuals to both invest in personal loans and request to borrow money. For borrowers you just log in and apply for a request on the website telling how much money you want to borrow. Then Soon after Prosper will list your request with some of your extra personal credit information on the website. Investors will see all the listings from borrowers and finally determine whether to invest or not based on the information posted.

The original data from Prosper contains about 110000 observations and 81 variables. This is quite a huge information. After a lot googling and looking at investor's dashboard at Prosper, I carefully select 11 variables that an investor might be interested in making a judgement about whether a listing is worth investing or not, and come up with an EDA report that performs an exploration of data from Prosper.com with about 110000 observations.

```{r echo=FALSE, Load_the_Data}
# Load the Data
prosperData <- read.csv('prosperLoanData.csv', na.strings = c('', 'NA'))

# calculate the average credit score
prosperData$CreditScoreAverage <- (prosperData$CreditScoreRangeUpper + prosperData$CreditScoreRangeUpper) / 2

# converting listing categories to factors
listingCategories <- c('Not Available', 'Debt Consolidation', 'Home Improvement', 'Business', 'Personal Loan', 'Student Use', 'Auto', 'Other', 'Baby&Adoption', 'Boat', 'Cosmetic Procedure', 'Engagement Ring', 'Green Loans', 'Household Expenses', 'Large Purchases', 'Medical/Dental', 'Motorcycle', 'RV', 'Taxes', 'Vacation', 'Wedding Loans')

listingLevels <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)

prosperData$ListingCategory <- factor(prosperData$ListingCategory..numeric.,
                                      levels = listingLevels,
                                      labels = listingCategories)

prosperData$IsBorrowerHomeowner <- as.logical(prosperData$IsBorrowerHomeowner)

# select variables interested
prosperDataSet <- select(prosperData, TradesNeverDelinquent..percentage., CreditScoreAverage, DebtToIncomeRatio, IsBorrowerHomeowner, LoanStatus, Occupation, ProsperScore, BorrowerState, ListingCategory, EmploymentStatus, EmploymentStatusDuration)
```

# Univariate Plots Section
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
dim(prosperDataSet)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
str(prosperDataSet)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
summary(prosperDataSet)
```
There are 12 variables to be explored, and the basic summaries are displayed above.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histograms for trades never delinquent percentage
ggplot(data = prosperDataSet, aes(x=TradesNeverDelinquent..percentage.)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```
Most borrowers have a percentage of "trades never delinquent/total trades"" above 60%, this shows a nice credit character in one aspect.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histogram for credit score average
pAvgCreditBox <- ggplot(data = prosperDataSet, aes(x='Avg Credit', y=CreditScoreAverage)) + geom_boxplot()
pAvgCreditHist <- ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=CreditScoreAverage)) + geom_histogram(bins=20)
grid.arrange(pAvgCreditBox, pAvgCreditHist, ncol=2)
```
From the histogram we can see that most average credit scores are between 500 and 899. But there is an outlier with about 19 score from the box plot. It is strange that an individual has such a tiny score.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
pDTI <- ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=DebtToIncomeRatio)) + geom_histogram(bins=50)
pDTIScaled <- ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=DebtToIncomeRatio)) + geom_histogram(bins=50) + scale_x_log10()
grid.arrange(pDTI, pDTIScaled, ncol=2)
```
Because the DTI-ratio historgram is very left-skewed, I make another log-transformed plot to better analyse the distribution of DTI ratios. Almost all DTI ratios are among 0.5 and 0.8.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x='Is Borrower Homeowner', fill=IsBorrowerHomeowner)) + 
  geom_bar(width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = 'y')
```
The pie chart tells us that almost a half of borrowers are home owners.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=LoanStatus)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))
```
There are nearly 50000 listings in status of "current", nearly 40000 in status of "completed", nearly 10000 in status of "charged off", nearly 5000 in status of "defaulted".There are some amount of past-due listings. 

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=Occupation)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))
```
Almost 30000 borrowers are not willing to tell their occupations. And "professional" has the most number of borrowers among known occupations.
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=ProsperScore)) + geom_histogram(bins=30)
```
Most borrowers' prosper score are between 3 and 9.
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=BorrowerState)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))
```
Nearly 15000 borrowers come for California.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=ListingCategory)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))
```
Among all the listing categories, the count of borrowings for debt consolidation is the biggest, it has about 60000.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
pEmployment <- ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=EmploymentStatus)) + geom_bar() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))
pEmploymentStatus <- ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=EmploymentStatusDuration)) + geom_histogram()
grid.arrange(pEmployment, pEmploymentStatus, ncol=2)
```
Among all the borrowers, there are more than 60000 are employees, and there are nearly 25000 full-time staffs. The distribution of employment status duration tells us that the most duration are under 200 months.

# Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?
My dataset contains 11 variables. Among them there are 4 numeric variables: CreditScoreAverage, DebtToIncomeRatio, ProsperScore, EmploymentStatusDuration, 6 factor variables: LoanStatus, Occupation, BorrowerState, ListingCategory, EmploymentStatus and 1 logic variable: IsBorrowerHomeowner.

LoanStatus: Cancelled, Chargedoff, Completed, Current, Defaulted, FinalPaymentInProgress, PastDues of various days;
Occupation: different kinds of jobs of borrowers;
BorrowerState: states of US that borrowers come from;
ListringCategory: different purposes that the borrowers borrow money for.

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
"LoanStatus" is the main feature of interest in my dataset. I want to explore how other features affect the status of loans, especially the loan in complete/default/chargedoff/past due. Are there any patterns existed in them respectively? How do investors selectively assess different features in dashboard when planning to invest some loans?

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
After researching on the article [The Five Câ€™s of Credit and Your Lending Strategy on Prosper](https://help.prosper.com/2008/01/17/the-five-cs-of-credit-and-your-lending-strategy-on-prosper/), I think credit score, DTI ratio, prosper score and listing categories likely contribute to the status of loan, and maybe the employment status and duration are important factors to consider. 

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?
Yes, since the original data gives credit score as a range value, I simply take the average of them to make a new variable called "CreditScoreAverage", this may simplifies the following analysis.

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?
Yes, the distribution of debt to income ratio is highly left-skewed, thus hard to analyze. So I perform a log scale transform on x axis, makes it more easier to figure out whar are the most common DTI ratios among all the borrowers.

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?

### What was the strongest relationship you found?
