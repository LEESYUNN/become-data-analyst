Prosper Exploration Data Analysis
========================================================

[Prosper](prosper.com) is one of the largest financial company who operates P2P lending business. It allows individuals to both invest in personal loans and request to borrow money. For borrowers you just log in and apply for a request on the website telling how much money you want to borrow. Then Soon after Prosper will list your request with some of your extra personal credit information on the website. Investors will see all the listings from borrowers and finally determine whether to invest or not based on the information posted.

The original data from Prosper contains about 110000 observations and 81 variables. This is quite a huge information. After a lot googling and looking at investor's dashboard at Prosper, I carefully select 11 variables that an investor might be interested in making a judgement about whether a listing is worth investing or not, and come up with an EDA report that performs an exploration of data from Prosper.com with about 110000 observations.

```{r echo=FALSE, Load_the_Data}
# Load the Data
prosperData <- read.csv('prosperLoanData.csv', na.strings = c('', 'NA'))

# calculate the average credit score
prosperData$CreditScoreAverage <- (prosperData$CreditScoreRangeUpper + prosperData$CreditScoreRangeUpper) / 2

# converting listing categories to factors
listingCategories <- c('Not Available', 'Debt Consolidation', 'Home Improvement', 'Business', 'Personal Loan', 'Student Use', 'Auto', 'Other', 'Baby&Adoption', 'Boat', 'Cosmetic Procedure', 'Engagement Ring', 'Green Loans', 'Household Expenses', 'Large Purchases', 'Medical/Dental', 'Motorcycle', 'RV', 'Taxes', 'Vacation', 'Wedding Loans')

listingLevels <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)

prosperData$ListingCategory <- factor(prosperData$ListingCategory..numeric.,
                                      levels = listingLevels,
                                      labels = listingCategories)

prosperData$IsBorrowerHomeowner <- as.logical(prosperData$IsBorrowerHomeowner)

# select variables interested
prosperDataSet <- select(prosperData, TradesNeverDelinquent..percentage., CreditScoreAverage, DebtToIncomeRatio, IsBorrowerHomeowner, LoanStatus, Occupation, ProsperScore, BorrowerState, ListingCategory, EmploymentStatus, EmploymentStatusDuration)
```

# Univariate Plots Section
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
dim(prosperDataSet)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
str(prosperDataSet)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
summary(prosperDataSet)
```
There are 12 variables to be explored, and the basic summaries are displayed above.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histograms for trades never delinquent percentage
ggplot(data = prosperDataSet, aes(x=TradesNeverDelinquent..percentage.)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```
Most borrowers have a percentage of "trades never delinquent/total trades"" above 60%, this shows a nice credit character in one aspect.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histogram for credit score average
pAvgCreditBox <- ggplot(data = prosperDataSet, aes(x='Avg Credit', y=CreditScoreAverage)) + geom_boxplot()
pAvgCreditHist <- ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=CreditScoreAverage)) + geom_histogram(bins=20)
grid.arrange(pAvgCreditBox, pAvgCreditHist, ncol=2)
```
From the histogram we can see that most average credit scores are between 500 and 899. But there is an outlier with about 19 score from the box plot. It is strange that an individual has such a tiny score.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
pDTI <- ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=DebtToIncomeRatio)) + geom_histogram(bins=50)
pDTIScaled <- ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=DebtToIncomeRatio)) + geom_histogram(bins=50) + scale_x_log10()
grid.arrange(pDTI, pDTIScaled, ncol=2)
```
Because the DTI-ratio historgram is very left-skewed, I make another log-transformed plot to better analyse the distribution of DTI ratios. Almost all DTI ratios are among 0.5 and 0.8.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x='Is Borrower Homeowner', fill=IsBorrowerHomeowner)) + 
  geom_bar(width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = 'y')
```
The pie chart tells us that almost a half of borrowers are home owners.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=LoanStatus)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))
```
Most listings are in status of "current"" and "completed"", then "charged off"" and "defaulted". There are a tiny amount of past-due listings. 

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
ggplot(data=prosperDataSet, aes(x=Occupation)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))
```
Almost 30000 borrowers are not willing to tell their occupations. And "professional" has the most number of borrowers among known occupations.
# Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?



# Bivariate Plots Section
```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}

```

# Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?

### What was the strongest relationship you found?




# Multivariate Plots Section

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots}

```

# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the strengths and limitations of your model.
