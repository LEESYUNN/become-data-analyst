Wine Exploration Data Analysis
========================================================

I choose the white wine dataset to perform exploration data analysis. This dataset contains quality and chemical compositions for 4898 white wine. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, packages}
# Load all of the packages that you end up using
# in your analysis in this code chunk.

# Notice that the parameter "echo" was set to FALSE for this code chunk.
# This prevents the code from displaying in the knitted HTML output.
# You should set echo=FALSE for all code chunks in your file.

```

```{r echo=FALSE, Load_the_Data}
# Load the Data
wineData <- read.csv('wineQualityWhites.csv', na.strings = c('', 'NA'))

# create a new variable called bound.sulfur.dioxide according to wineQualityInfo.txt
wineData$bound.sulfur.dioxide <- wineData$total.sulfur.dioxide - wineData$free.sulfur.dioxide

# select and rearrange variables
wineData <- select(wineData, quality, fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, citric.acid, residual.sugar, chlorides, free.sulfur.dioxide, bound.sulfur.dioxide, sulphates, density, pH, alcohol)
```
# Univariate Plots Section
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
dim(wineData)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
str(wineData)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
summary(wineData)
```
The dataset contains 12 variables and almost 5000 observations. No NAs existed.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histogram of quality scores
ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=quality)) + geom_bar()
```
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
table(wineData$quality)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
summary(wineData$quality)
```
The lowest quality is 3 and the highest is 9; mean 5.878 and median 6. Most of the wine is in quality 5, 6 and 7. Wine with very high or low quality is rare.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histogram of fixed acidity
pOrigin <- ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=fixed.acidity)) + geom_histogram()
pBinned <- ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=fixed.acidity)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.12)
grid.arrange(pOrigin, pBinned, ncol=1)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
summary(wineData$fixed.acidity)
```
Most of the wine has a fixed acidity between 6 and 7.5 $g/dm^3$. There is a peak around 7 $g/dm^3$. Mean 6.855 $g/dm^3$ and median 6.80 $g/dm^3$; the maximum is 14.2 $g/dm^3$ and the minimum is 3.8 $g/dm^3$.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histogram of volatile acidity
ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=volatile.acidity)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
summary(wineData$volatile.acidity)
```
Most of the wine has a volatile acidity between 0.15 and 0.31 $g/dm^3$ approximately. The mininum value is not much less than the maxinum.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histogram of citric acidity
ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=citric.acid)) + geom_histogram()
```
Most of the white wine has a citric acidity between 0.25 and 0.4 $g/dm^3$. From all the three plots above we can see that the distribution of acidity in wine is somewhat normal.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histogram and boxplot of residual sugar
pSugarHist <- ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=residual.sugar)) + geom_histogram(bins=100)
pSugarHistScaled <- ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=residual.sugar)) + geom_histogram(bins=100) + scale_x_log10()
pSugarBox <- ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x='residual sugar', y=residual.sugar)) + geom_boxplot()
grid.arrange(pSugarHist, pSugarHistScaled, pSugarBox, ncol=3)
```
Because the histogram is highly left-skewed, I create a log-transformed version in middle. And we can see from the log-tranformed histogram that the residual sugar of most white wine is below 15 $g/dm^3$. But from the boxplot there are some outliers with high value above 60 $g/dm^3$, that's too sweet.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histogram of sugar-acidity ratio
ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=sugar.acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=60)
```
This shows the distribution of sugar/acidity ratio. Most of the white wine has a ratio between 0 and 2.5.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histogram of salt
ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=chlorides)) + geom_histogram(bins=200)
```
Most of the white wine has chlorides between 0.01 and 0.05 $g/dm^3$, this is the amount of salt in wine. A too high value may lead the wine too salty.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histograms about free, bound sulfur dioxide and sulphates
pFreeSulfur <- ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=free.sulfur.dioxide)) + geom_histogram()
pBoundSulfur <- ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=bound.sulfur.dioxide)) + geom_histogram()
pSulphates <- ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=sulphates)) + geom_histogram()
grid.arrange(pFreeSulfur, pBoundSulfur, pSulphates, ncol=3)
```
The chemical composition of sulfur dioxide can prevent microbial growth and oxidation of wine. But it is somewhat harmful so the amount has to be limited. Most of the wine has a free sulfur dioxide below 100 $mg/dm^3$, a bound one between 50 - 150 $mg/dm^3$. Sulphates is an wine additive that can keep sulfur dioxide levels, most wine has about 0.3 - 0.6 $mg/dm^3$

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histogram of density
ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=density)) + geom_histogram(bins=100)
```
Most wine has a density around 1.00 $g/cm^3$.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histogram of pH
ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=pH)) + geom_histogram()
```
All the wine is naturally acidic. And most of them are in pH 3.0 - 3.3.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# histograms of alcohol
ggplot(data=wineData, aes(x=alcohol)) + geom_histogram(bins=60)
```
White wine is a kind of low-alcohol drink. Most of them has alcohol range from 9% to 12% by volume.

# Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?
TODO: put it above
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
str(wineData)
```
This dataset contains 13 variables. All of them are numeric, representing different kinds of chemical compositions about white wine.

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
"quanlity" is the main feature of interest in my dataset. I want to figure out how these chemical compositions affect the taste of white wine.

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
I guess variables about acidity, residual sugar, chlorides, pH and alcohol will help support the investigation of quality.

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?
Yes, I create a new variable called "sugar.acidity" defined as total acidity divided by residual sugar, and a new variable "bound.sulfur.dioxide" defined as total sulfur dioxide minus free sulfur dioxide.

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?
Yes, the histogram of residual sugar is highly left-skewed, this makes it difficult to analyze. So I create a log-transformed histogram to better investigate the distribution of residual sugar in white wine, because this is one of the important factors that might affect the taste of wine.


# Bivariate Plots Section
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}
set.seed(8341)
ggpairs(wineData[sample.int(nrow(wineData), 2500), ])

Based on the scatter plot matrix, there are no strong correlations existed.
```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}

# Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?

### What was the strongest relationship you found?




# Multivariate Plots Section
